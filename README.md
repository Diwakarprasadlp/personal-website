<h1>Personal Website</h1>

This is a standard web application that will serve as a personal website as well as a future blogging platform. I am using this as a tool to learn Node.js as well as front-end package managers such as Bower, Grunt, and Yeoman. I am using jade as my templating and sass for my styling.
