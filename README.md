It began as a simple wireframe, one million iterations later, this project is now my personal website.

### Goals:
This was my first project where I decided I really wanted to get into front-end development. Throughout this process the designs became more complex as I learned how to execute them from a technical standpoint. I started this project barely knowing the difference between a section and a div tag and I had no idea how absolute positioning worked.

### Result:
At the end of this project I had learned Jade, SCSS, Express, Heroku, Gulp, Bower, and various best-practices such as g-zip compression, image CDN hosting, and hardware accelerated CSS animations and transitions. I implemented the scrolling animation using Greensock's GSAP animation framework and used various native CSS3 animations to engineer the floating labels and moving gears. I also learned how to use Express and Node.js to implement the contact form using a Mailgun transporter as well as handle the download for the pdf copy of my resume. I also used this project to get a better handle on SCSS modularity and mobile-first responsive techniques, and as a result the website is completely responsive and mobile friendly.
