<h1>My Personal Website</h1>
This project will serve as my About Me and my portfolio. I am using Node.js in cunjunction with Express. I am using Jade for my HTML engine and SCSS as my CSS pre-processor. This application will initially be written monolithically and I will refactor it at a later time and implement an Angular front-end and MongoDB to hold various files.

My goal with this project is to understand the difficulties that come with a monolithic application by working with one, then refactor it into a more service oriented application with Angular to understand the differences and challenges overcome using that architecture first-hand. I also created the design, all iterations of it can be seen a: https://www.behance.net/wip/753351. I wanted to fully explore each design and understand how each element can gracefully respond to a responsive layout while still maintaining the context of the design.
